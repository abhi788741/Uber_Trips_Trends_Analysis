## Uber Trip Data Analysis 🚖

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Uber trip data to uncover patterns in ride demand, trip duration, and pricing. The goal is to apply data analytics techniques (Excel, SQL, Python, Pandas, and visualization tools) to generate meaningful insights for decision-making.

The dataset includes details about Uber rides such as pickup/drop-off locations, timestamps, trip distances, and fares. Through this project, we explore trends in user behavior, ride patterns, and operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning (handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies).

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find hidden patterns.

Analyze trip demand by time of day, weekday, and location.

Study trip duration and distance patterns.

Create visualizations & dashboards to present insights clearly.

Provide business recommendations for Uber.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle / Government Open Data Portal

Size: ~9k+ rows

Columns:

trip_id – Unique identifier for each trip

pickup_datetime – Date & time of pickup

dropoff_datetime – Date & time of dropoff

pickup_location – Pickup location (lat-long or zone)

dropoff_location – Dropoff location (lat-long or zone)

trip_distance – Distance of trip (in km/miles)

fare_amount – Fare charged for the trip

payment_type – Method of payment (cash, Google pay,Uber pay etc.)

surge fair - average fair of trips

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Excel → Initial cleaning & pivot analysis

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) → Query-based insights

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data wrangling & visualization

Tableau / Power BI → Dashboard creation

## 📊 Key Insights

Peak demand occurs during morning (7–9 AM) and evening (5–8 PM).

Fridays and Saturdays record higher ride volume compared to weekdays.

Average trip distance is ~6 miles, but fares vary significantly by pickup zones.

Surge pricing is more frequent in downtown areas during peak hours.

## 📌 Deliverables

Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

SQL scripts for querying trip data.

Python notebooks with EDA and visualizations.

Dashboard showing demand trends, top pickup/drop-off zones, and fare patterns.

Business recommendations for improving Uber operations.

## 📌 Future Scope

Build a predictive model for trip fare or demand forecasting.

Add geospatial analysis using Folium/GeoPandas.

Real-time dashboard for live ride monitoring.
